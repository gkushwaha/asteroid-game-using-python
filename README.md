# asteroid-game-using-python

Player can shoot the asteroid using bullet (space key). Player is able to move by using up, down, left and right arrow. Every bullet decreases asteroid power and after the asteroids losses all its power it is busted into other smaller asteroids. The score gets updated every time an asteroid is busted. I have used pygame for this project.
